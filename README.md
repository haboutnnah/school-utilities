In **parse_timetable/**, there is a script that reads a list of people's Sentral timetables and exports them to a .csv so you can see who you have in your classes.

In **calendar-parse/**, there is a script that reads a Sentral formatted .ics file and transforms it to be more human readable.

Rewritten in Python for 2019, the powershell versions are there as well but they require much more manual entry so I remade them.
